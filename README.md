## About

This repository is part of the Summer internship at SberTech, a subsidiary of Sberbank's IT company. 
Internship was focused on the design and development of a system implemented using a microservice architecture.

Was necessary to implement a platform that would allow performing the following actions:
+  Combine photos into collections
+  Share your collections with other users
+  Maintain a rating within the collection
+  Add tags to photos
+  Write annotations to photos

Was decided to create a system consisting of a set of microservices in the amount of four parts.
Development was carried out in teams of three to four people. Our team carried out the design and development of a microservice for user data and access control.

#### List of microservices

+  [API Gateway and Service Discovery](https://github.com/lenivoe/summer-2020-SBT-team1)
+  [Microservice for content and metadata management](https://github.com/ASurtaev/SummerSberPractice)
+  [Collections and rating microservice](https://github.com/BorZzzenko/SummerPractice_SBT2020)
+  [Auth/Validation and user permissions microservice](https://github.com/D076/summer-practice-2020-SBT)

## Installation

Use the pa—Åkage manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for building.

Edit **application.cfg**:
+  Step 1: Fills DATABASE_URL with your database login and password (postgresql://user:password@host/database)
+  Step 2 (Optionally): Fills gateway host and port

#### Windows
```bash
git clone https://github.com/D076/summer-practice-2020-SBT/
cd summer-practice-2020-SBT
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
python manage.py runserver [-h HOST] [-p PORT]
```

#### Linux and macOS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/D076/summer-practice-2020-SBT/
cd summer-practice-2020-SBT
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py db init
python3 manage.py db migrate
python3 manage.py db upgrade
python3 manage.py runserver [-h HOST] [-p PORT]
```

For generating roles and permissions run **roles_permissions.sql** script in your database.
