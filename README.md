## About

For the purpose of convenient distribution of photos, supplemented, if necessary, with information, and receiving prompt and convenient feedback in the form of a rating, it was decided to develop a service.
The developed system allows you to upload photos, combine them into collections, as well as rate them and share them with friends. The system was divided into microservices, each of which was commissioned by one of the four teams participating in this practice.
Development was carried out in teams of three to four people. Our team carried out the design and development of a microservice for user data and access control.

#### List of microservices

## Installation

Edit **application.cfg**:
+  Step 1: Fills DATABASE_URL with your database login and password (postgresql://user:password@host/database)
+  Step 2 (Optionally): Fills gateway host and port

#### Windows
```bash
git clone https://github.com/D076/summer-practice-2020-SBT/
cd summer-practice-2020-SBT
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
python manage.py runserver [-h HOST] [-p PORT]
```

#### Linux and macOS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/D076/summer-practice-2020-SBT/
cd summer-practice-2020-SBT
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py db init
python3 manage.py db migrate
python3 manage.py db upgrade
python3 manage.py runserver [-h HOST] [-p PORT]
